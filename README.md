### What should I know before I get started?

#### Setup and IDE Plugins

Currently no IDE plugins are necessary to host ChefConnect locally. There are, however some useful tools that can streamline your development process. For example, setting up [VSCode with Prettier](https://blog.yogeshchavan.dev/automatically-format-code-on-file-save-in-visual-studio-code-using-prettier) will help you automatically format your code correctly. Past that, you can check out the NPM dependencies you'll need by checking the top and sub-level package.json files in the [ChefConnect repo](https://github.com/danielbrathwaite/ChefConnect).

### Coding Standards

This project and everyone participating in it is expected to operate with positive intentions. Our mission is to bring together people with a love of the culinary arts and people who enjoy a good meal. Any malicious and / or unsafe coding practices are strictly prohibited. Violation of this principle will result in a complete and immediate ban from all ChefConnect affiliations.
